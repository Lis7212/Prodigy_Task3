# Decision Tree Classifier for Predicting Customer Purchases

This repository contains Python code for building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset provided in bank.csv. It includes the following features:
- age: Customer's age
- job: Customer's job category
- marital: Customer's marital status
- education: Customer's education level
- default: Whether the customer has credit in default (yes/no)
- balance: Customer's account balance
- housing: Whether the customer has a housing loan (yes/no)
- loan: Whether the customer has a personal loan (yes/no)
- contact: Type of communication contact
- day: Last contact day of the month
- month: Last contact month of the year
- duration: Duration of the last contact in seconds
- campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign
- pdays: Number of days since the customer was last contacted
- previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign
- poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign
- deposit: Whether the customer made a deposit (yes/no)

## Setup
To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided Python script `Prodigy_Task3.ipynb`.
3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train a decision tree classifier, evaluate its performance, and visualize the decision tree.
4. You can adjust parameters or modify the code as needed for your specific use case.
